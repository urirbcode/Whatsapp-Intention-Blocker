# WhatsApp Web Intention Prompt

This Chrome extension helps you stay focused and intentional while using WhatsApp Web. It prompts you to record your intention for using WhatsApp each time you open or switch to the tab, encouraging mindfulness and reducing distractions.

## Why use this extension?

Many of us struggle with distractions and procrastination when using social media platforms like WhatsApp. This extension aims to combat this by:

*   **Encouraging mindfulness:** The intention prompt forces you to pause and consider why you're opening WhatsApp Web. This can help you avoid mindless scrolling and stay focused on your goals.
   
*   **Promoting accountability:** By recording your intention, you're holding yourself accountable to using WhatsApp Web for that specific purpose. This can help you avoid getting sidetracked by other conversations or notifications.
   
*   **Improving productivity:** By staying focused and intentional, you can use WhatsApp Web more efficiently and get things done faster.
   

## How it works

1.  Install the extension by following the instructions below.
   
2.  Open or switch to a WhatsApp Web tab.
   
3.  You'll be prompted with a pop-up asking for your intention for using WhatsApp Web.
   
4.  You can either:
   
   *   **Record your intention:** Type in your specific purpose for using WhatsApp Web (e.g., "Respond to urgent messages", "Connect with a specific contact").
       
   *   **Close the tab:** If you don't have a clear intention, you can choose to close the tab and avoid getting distracted.
       

The extension remembers your last intention and won't prompt you again for a short period of time. This ensures that you're not constantly interrupted while using WhatsApp Web for focused tasks.
